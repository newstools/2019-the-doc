30 September 2019 Good morning Programme Director;The Deputy Minister of Women, Youth, and Persons with Disabilities, Prof Hlengiwe Mkhize;The Wits University’s Dean of Student Affairs, Jerome September;The President of the World Youth Summit, Mr Hassan Rengou Mfouakie;The Director General of the World Youth Summit, Mr Raymond Matlala;The Secretary General of the World Youth Summit, Mr Fawad Ali Langah;The UNFPA Representative: Ms. Beatrice Mutali;The African Union Representative: Dr Shakira Choonara; The UNICEF Representative;Honoured guests and Delegates joining us from across the world;Ladies and gentlemen For those of you that don’t know, my career did not start out in politics, it started out in teaching, and essentially I will always be a teacher, so I’m therefore extremely heartened that your summit this year will be focussing on the 4th Sustainable Development Goal – the education goal, aiming to “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.” In many parts of the world young women face very specific challenges in terms of securing and completing an education, and for various reasons. In some countries education is not something they are entitled to, or is actually the least of their concerns, as their struggles are much bigger. My final message is directly to the youth represented here today. What is absolutely critical to the success of the 2030 Agenda and the SDG’s, is the role of the youth in proactively engaging with your local and national government in delivering on policies and programmes on the ground. Your role as the youth in public-private partnerships in driving the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, and participation in informing equitable and diverse policy design and implementation, is crucial. With that said, I thank you! Malibongwe!
