It is well documented that Cybercrime continues to evolve, with new threats surfacing every year. Cyber criminals commit crimes by targeting sensitive data in computers, mobile devices or networks. Cybercrimes include security breaches, identity theft, cyber-stalking, harassment, bullying, and child sexual exploitation. According to Deputy Minister Kekana, the department has developed awareness programmes to educate all South Africans about the dangers presented by cyberspace. While making the communities aware of the threats we should not deter them from interacting online or conducting business. The basic precautions to cybersecurity include not disclosing personal information such as passwords for computers or PINs for bank cards. All online transactions should be done from a trusted computers or terminals. Further as part of cyber security awareness initiative, the department will also be training 60 Women from Makhado Municipality on Digital Literacy skills in partnership with Siyafunda Community Technology Centre.
