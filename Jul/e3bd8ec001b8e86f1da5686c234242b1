On 5 July 2019, the Ministry of Communications & Digital Technologies and North West Provincial Government in collaboration with Nokia and Vodacom; will host the first-of-its-kind, live holographic projection of the Digital Economy Summit in Rustenburg, North West. The inaugural Digital Economy Summit seeks to kickstart a wide-ranging societal dialogue on the challenges and opportunities of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). This high-level dialogue, driven and informed by research from the universities and other national research institutions, aims to stimulate and curate a coherent national action plan that galvanises industry, labour, academia, public sector and society at large. As the summit’s opening ceremony commences at Gallagher Estate in Midrand wherein President Cyril Ramaphosa is scheduled to deliver the opening keynote address, a real-time simulation led by the Premier, Prof. Job Mokgoro will take place at the Rustenburg Civic Centre. This will be the first live holographic broadcast of a Head of State, thus showcasing South Africa’s readiness to be a leader in the 4IR. A 3D hologram is a projection that exists freely in space and is visible without the need for 3D glasses. It displays products, objects, and animated sequences three-dimensionally and enables seemingly real objects or animations to appear to float completely freely in space. This method of using a 3D hologram opens up a completely new, revolutionary way of presenting products.
