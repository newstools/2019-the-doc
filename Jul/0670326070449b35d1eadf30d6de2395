12 July 2019 The Deputy Minister in The Presidency of the Republic of South Africa, Ms Thembi Siweya, will, on 13 July 2019, support the Web Rangers Digital Literacy Training Programme and Outreach at Pax College, Limpopo. The Deputy Minister will be joined by the Media Development and Diversity Agency (MDDA) and other stakeholders from government and the private sector. Web Rangers is a digital literacy programme designed to allow young people to gain critical skills and knowledge around online safety and media literacy, which they use to create innovative campaigns that promote safe internet usage and champion their rights in the digital world. For the year 2019, the programme has officially trained 239 Web Rangers in the Gauteng, North West  and Western Cape province of South Africa. The outreach is intended to introduce the Web Rangers Programme to learners and teachers at Pax college with the view of expanding the programme’s reach to four provinces. It will give teachers and learners an opportunity to improve their digital and media literacy skills, ensuring they can develop into active digital citizens. Government recognises the pressing need to research and support children’s rights in a digital age, to harness the positive potential of children’s internet use and to limit the harm. It is therefore vital to understand how children are developing digital skills and citizenship, and to use the evidence to inform future policy and practice in a way that also includes the voices of children and parents.
